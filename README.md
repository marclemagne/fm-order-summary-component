## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Making the web more beautiful, fast, and open through great typography
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - A cloud platform
- Semantic (:sweat_smile:) HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I kept a [development log](./development-log.md) while working on this project which contains an account of what I learned, what I've forgotten, weird things I ran into, and some of the trade-offs I made.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The Tailwind documentation is critical for figuring out how to translate CSS to Tailwind. The site is a bit slow, though, so even better is the Visual Studio Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
